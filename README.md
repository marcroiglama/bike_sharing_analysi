# bike_sharing_analysis
The data is coming from https://citybik.es/, a repository of all the bike-sharing sevices around the world. Using the script tempo.py it's possible to get the real-time data from the web and work with it. The code must be changed indicating the service you want to analyze, the example is for Bicing from Barcelona. 

The aim of this project is to do a firts approach of a real world data analasys going through all the steps, from the raw data to the data-visualization. 

Many thanks to my work-mates Nil Noya and Eduard Blanco.
